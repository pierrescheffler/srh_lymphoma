This is the repository accompanying our publication on the AI-based classification of lymphoma and glioblastoma biopsies. More to come soon.

Our model is based on [CTransPath](https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath). The weights of the model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/pierrescheffler/srh_lymphoma).
